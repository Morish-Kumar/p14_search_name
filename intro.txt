using the class concept to make the class based components

class is an alernative to functional components
class based components must contain arender method to output on the screen

functional component is a modern way of creating components
we can mix both class and functional component in a project

in class based based component state is alway a object and nothing else

to manage side effect in class based component we can not use react hooks such as useEffect hook

componentDidMount method - called only once when the component is evaluated and rendered
componentDidUpdate - called only once when the component updated is evaluated and rendered
componentWillUnmount - called right before when the component are removed from DOM
